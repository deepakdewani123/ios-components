This project aims to give you a reference and eliminate the hours you spend on searching for syntax of code to implement in your projects. Whether you're learning iOS application developement for knowledge or you are working on your dream project, you can use this project as your starting guide for using various basic iOS components e.g. UITableView, UICollectionView, etc.

See the demo app to play with all the components.

## Project Details

## Developer Note
* **Why did I make this project?**
When I started iOS Application Development three years ago, I couldn't find any useful resources on the internet to learn from, and as anyone starting fresh in any field, I too had many questions. Sometimes I would get the answer to my problem but many times I would not find appropriate solutions and would scratch my head wishing that someone could help me solve my problem. After these hard years having gained significant experience in the field, I want to share my experience with others who are looking to solve their problems in the wild.

* **Future Plans**
I am planning to make Video Tutorials for iOS Programming, but given the time constraints in my professional job as an iOS Developer, I could only devote so much of my time in this only if people are interested in it. So if you like my work, please give it a star, and after completing 100+ stars, I will start making the tutorials.
### Support

Open an issue or shoot me an email. Check out previous issues to see if your's has already been solved. (I would prefer an issue over an email. But will still happily respond to an email.)
